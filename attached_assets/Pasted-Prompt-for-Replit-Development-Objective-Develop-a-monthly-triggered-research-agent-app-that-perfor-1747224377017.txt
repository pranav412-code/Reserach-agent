Prompt for Replit Development:
Objective: Develop a monthly-triggered research agent app that performs market research in the manufacturing/IIoT sector, analyzes current industry trends, problems, and solutions, and generates a comprehensive report. The app will utilize Gemini (LLM) and LangChain to orchestrate the data collection and analysis workflow.

Components:
LLM: Gemini (Google) for text generation and analysis.

Framework: LangChain for tool orchestration and agent management.

Tools:

Web Search Tool: Use Tavily or another search engine API for gathering relevant articles, blogs, and industry news.

Web Scraping Tool: Use BeautifulSoup or Scrapy for extracting useful data from industry-specific websites.

Social Media Tool: Use LinkedIn APIs for extracting relevant posts and articles (public pages) in the manufacturing/IIoT domain.

Database: Use SQLite or a simple NoSQL solution for storing collected data for report generation.

Workflow:
Manual Trigger: The agent is triggered manually once every month to start data collection.

Data Collection:

Perform web searches using the search tool (e.g., Tavily) to find articles, reports, and blogs about industry trends and challenges.

Use scraping to collect structured data from relevant websites.

Extract social media insights from LinkedIn based on the latest professional discussions related to manufacturing/IIoT.

Data Processing:

Use LangChain to clean, structure, and organize the collected data.

Analysis:

Pass the structured data to Gemini for trend identification, challenge analysis, and insight generation.

Identify how SenseLive’s solutions can solve the identified challenges.

Report Generation:

Generate a detailed, comprehensive report, including:

Industry trends and problems

SenseLive’s solutions

Content for future email campaigns and newsletters.

Data Storage:

Store the generated reports in a local database for future reference and use by other agents.

Development Notes:
Focus on building the web scraping, search, and LinkedIn tools first before integrating Gemini and LangChain for report generation.

Make sure the agent is flexible for future enhancements such as automatic triggers and real-time data updates.

Ensure the LLM (Gemini) is trained or properly fine-tuned to generate industry-relevant insights from the collected data.

Deliverables:
A functional app that can collect data, process it, and generate a comprehensive research report on a monthly basis.

Documentation on how to use the app, including setup, manual trigger, and data collection process.
